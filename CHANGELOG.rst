0.7.0-beta1
===========

This is the first beta release of asimov 0.7, building on the alpha releases
with first-class Slurm support, a hardened report system, and a number of
event-application and ledger bug fixes.  The architectural changes introduced
in the alpha series (state machine monitor, flexible dependency system, Python
API, pydantic priors) are now considered stable for beta testing.

New Features
------------

**First-class Slurm Scheduler Support**
  Asimov now ships with a full Slurm scheduler backend.  The implementation
  includes bidirectional DAG translation (HTCondor ↔ Slurm), so workflow
  graphs defined for one scheduler can be executed on the other without
  changes to the blueprint.  End-to-end CI coverage for Slurm has been added
  alongside the existing HTCondor suite.

Improvements
------------

**Hardened HTML Report Pages**
  The HTML report system has been substantially improved and hardened.  Subject
  analysis reports now render correctly, graph data generation has been
  refactored for correctness, and the overall report layout has been polished.

**CBCFlow Integration Tests**
  Integration tests for CBCFlow have been added, and ``apply_via_plugin`` has
  been updated to use the current ledger state rather than a stale snapshot.

**Enhanced Scheduler Testing Pipelines**
  Scheduler support and its associated testing pipelines have been further
  extended and hardened following the initial Slurm integration.

Bug Fixes
---------

**Event Application Reliability**
  Several bugs in the event-apply path have been fixed, covering analysis
  application ordering, ledger persistence during apply, and edge cases in
  the event update workflow.

**Ledger I/O Fix**
  A bug in ledger reading and writing that could corrupt state under certain
  conditions has been corrected.

Breaking Changes
----------------

**Waveform Minimum Frequency Location**
  The ``minimum frequency`` parameter **must** now be placed in the ``waveform``
  section of a blueprint.  In earlier versions, placing it in the ``quality`` or
  ``likelihood`` sections was permitted with a deprecation warning.  As of v0.7,
  any blueprint that specifies ``minimum frequency`` under ``quality`` or
  ``likelihood`` will be **rejected** with a ``ValueError`` and the blueprint
  will not be applied.

  To migrate an existing blueprint, move the value from the old location::

      # Old (no longer valid in v0.7)
      quality:
        minimum frequency:
          H1: 20
          L1: 20

  to the new location::

      # Correct (v0.7+)
      waveform:
        minimum frequency:
          H1: 20
          L1: 20

  The error message will indicate which section the value was found in and
  prompt the user to update their blueprint accordingly.

0.7.0-alpha1
============

This is the first alpha of a major feature release representing a significant evolution of asimov's architecture and capabilities. It introduces powerful new workflow management features, a modernised monitoring system, and enhanced programmatic control.

Major New Features
------------------

**State Machine Architecture**
  The monitor loop has been completely refactored into a state machine pattern, providing better control flow, plugin support, and pipeline-specific handlers. This enables more sophisticated workflow management and better extensibility.

**Advanced Dependency System**
  Implements a flexible dependency specification system with property-based filtering, AND/OR/negation logic, staleness tracking, and workflow graph integration. This allows complex relationships between analyses to be expressed naturally.

**Strategy Expansion**
  New strategy expansion feature enables creating multiple analyses from parameter matrices, making it easy to run parameter studies and systematic variations.

**Python API**
  Comprehensive Python API for project creation and management, including context manager support for programmatic control of asimov workflows.

**Enhanced HTML Reports**
  HTML reports now include graph-based workflow visualization with interactive modal popups, advanced filtering, and improved styling for better workflow monitoring.

**Blueprint Validator**
  Introduces validation for blueprint files to catch configuration errors early and ensure consistent project setup.

**Modern Prior Handling**
  Refactored prior handling with pydantic validation and pipeline-specific interfaces, providing better type safety and clearer error messages.

Changes
-------

**Thread-Safe Logging**
  File logging setup has been refactored to ensure thread safety with shared locks, and logging is now lazy-loaded to prevent log file creation for read-only commands.

**PESummary Modernization**
  PESummary has been converted to a SubjectAnalysis with optional dependency support, enabling more flexible post-processing workflows.

**Improved Testing Infrastructure**
  Added minimal testing pipelines for SimpleAnalysis, SubjectAnalysis, and ProjectAnalysis. Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for HTCondor and LALInference end-to-end testing with concurrent execution.

**Build System Migration**
  Migrated from setup.py to pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging standards.

**Plugin Flexibility**
  Enhanced plugin system with additional flexibility for extending asimov's capabilities.

**Scheduler Improvements**
  Scheduler refresh implementation for better job management.

**Removed Legacy Assumptions**
  Removed calibration categories and fixed hardcoded git branch assumptions for greater flexibility in deployment environments.

Breaking Changes
----------------

This release introduces significant architectural changes. While efforts have been made to maintain backward compatibility where possible, some changes in behavior are expected, particularly in:

- Monitor loop behavior due to state machine refactoring
- Dependency specification syntax (old syntax may need updating)
- Prior specification format (now uses pydantic models)

0.6.0
=====

This is a major feature release which introduces some change in functionality which may have a minor effect on backwards compatibility.

New features
------------

*New analysis types*: asimov 0.6.0 introduces two new kinds of analysis: subject analyses, which allow an analysis to access configurations and results from multiple other analyses defined on a given event or subject, and project analyses which allow access to multiple analyses to be accessed across multiple events. These will allow much more complicated workflows than before which allow combinations of large numbers of subsidiary results.


Changes
-------

*Deprecation warnings*: Deprecation warnings have been added to each of the pipelines (bilby, pesummary, lalinference, rift, and bayeswave) which are currently supported "out of the box" by asimov, as these will be removed in asimov 0.7 and replaced with plugins.

*Bilby*: The online pe argument has been removed from the bilby configuration template as this has been deprecated.

*Removal of gitlab interfaces*: More logic related to the disused and deprecated gitlab issue tracker interface has been removed.

*Removal of calibration envelope logic*: We have removed the logic required to find calibration files on the LIGO Scientific Collaboration computing resources. These have been moved to the asimov-gwdata pipeline, which will be used in O4 collaboration analyses.

Deprecation
-----------

+ All pipeline interfaces in the main package have been deprecated, and will be removed in v0.7.0

Major New Features
-------------------

Projects
""""""""

This version of asimov represents a major update compared to the previously released versions of asimov.
In the past asimov has relied on gitlab issue trackers in order to organise a project.
In this version we introduce infrastructure within asimov to enable management of much smaller projects as well as those asimov was initially intended for.
Projects can now be created in a user's home directory and used to organise and automate multiple runs.

Pipeline interface improvements
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We've made a serious effort in this version to improve the interface between asimov and various gravitational wave analysis pipelines, including Bayeswave, bilby, and lalinference.
We've made it much easier to use other pipelines with asimov too, which can now be implemented as plugins without requiring upstream changes to the asimov codebase.

Reporting improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""

We've introduced a number of new features to the report pages which are created by asimov in order to give a more useful overview of all of the analyses which are being run.

Command-line interface
""""""""""""""""""""""

Asimov now has a cleaner, and more consistent command line interface, which has been renamed ``asimov``.
When we started work on the project we weren't sure how asimov would be used, but we've come to the conclusion that having everything named consistently is for the best.

Blueprint files
"""""""""""""""

Setting up events and analyses in asimov requires a large amount of information.
To assist with this, asimov is now able to read-in this information in yaml-format files which we call "blueprints".
A curated collection of these for the events included in the GWTC catalogues, and the analyses used for those catalogues are available from https://git.ligo.org/asimov/data.
