The Asimov Ledger
=================

The ledger is the central source of information within a project, and stores information about events and analyses.

Data in the ledger is hierarchical, so settings can be specified on a per-project, per-event, and per-analysis level, allowing project-wide defaults to be set, but overwritten when required.
In addition defaults can be set for each pipeline.

In this documentation we'll represent the ledger in ``yaml`` format, however a number of other storage methods for the ledger are also supported by asimov.

Ledger Storage Backends
-----------------------

Asimov supports multiple storage backends for the ledger, each with different characteristics:

YAML File Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The YAML file backend stores the ledger as a human-readable YAML file. This is the default backend and is suitable for single-user scenarios or small projects.

**Configuration:**

.. code-block:: ini

   [ledger]
   engine = yamlfile
   location = .asimov/ledger.yml

**Advantages:**

- Human-readable and easy to edit
- No external dependencies
- Simple backup and version control

**Limitations:**

- Limited concurrency support (uses file locking)
- Performance degrades with large ledgers
- Not suitable for multi-user concurrent access

Database Backend (SQLAlchemy)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The database backend uses SQLAlchemy to provide robust, transactional storage with support for concurrent access. This is recommended for production environments and multi-user scenarios.

**Configuration:**

.. code-block:: ini

   [ledger]
   engine = sqlalchemy
   location = /path/to/ledger.db

**Supported Databases:**

- SQLite (default, no additional setup required)
- PostgreSQL (for production deployments)
- MySQL/MariaDB (for production deployments)

**Advantages:**

- **ACID transactions** ensure data integrity
- **Thread-safe** operations with proper locking
- **Concurrent access** support for multi-user environments
- **Advanced querying** capabilities with filters and sorting
- **Scalable** to large numbers of events and analyses
- **Race condition protection** for parallel workflows

**Configuration Examples:**

SQLite (local file):

.. code-block:: ini

   [ledger]
   engine = sqlalchemy
   location = .asimov/ledger.db

PostgreSQL (production server):

.. code-block:: ini

   [ledger]
   engine = sqlalchemy
   location = postgresql://user:password@localhost/asimov_ledger

MySQL:

.. code-block:: ini

   [ledger]
   engine = sqlalchemy
   location = mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/asimov_ledger

Database Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The database backend uses the following tables:

**events**
  Stores event information including name, repository, working directory, and metadata.
  
**productions**
  Stores production/analysis information linked to events via foreign key relationship.
  Includes name, pipeline, status, and metadata.
  
**project_analyses**
  Stores project-level analyses that span multiple events.

All metadata is stored as JSON, preserving flexibility for pipeline-specific settings.

Querying the Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The database backend supports advanced querying:

.. code-block:: python

   from asimov.ledger import DatabaseLedger
   
   # Initialize ledger
   ledger = DatabaseLedger(engine="sqlalchemy")
   
   # Query events
   events = ledger.get_event()  # All events
   event = ledger.get_event("GW150914")  # Specific event
   
   # Query productions with filters
   prods = ledger.get_productions(
       event="GW150914",
       filters={"status": "ready", "pipeline": "bilby"}
   )
   
   # Get all ready bilby productions across all events
   ready_bilby = ledger.get_productions(
       filters={"status": "ready", "pipeline": "bilby"}
   )

Migration from YAML to Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To migrate an existing YAML ledger to a database:

.. code-block:: python

   from asimov.ledger import YAMLLedger, DatabaseLedger
   
   # Load existing YAML ledger
   yaml_ledger = YAMLLedger(".asimov/ledger.yml")
   
   # Create new database ledger
   db_ledger = DatabaseLedger.create(engine="sqlalchemy")
   
   # Migrate events
   for event in yaml_ledger.get_event():
       db_ledger.add_event(event)
   
   # Migrate project analyses
   for analysis in yaml_ledger.project_analyses:
       db_ledger.add_analysis(analysis)

Transaction Safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All database operations are wrapped in transactions, ensuring:

- **Atomicity**: Operations either complete fully or are rolled back
- **Consistency**: Database constraints are enforced
- **Isolation**: Concurrent operations don't interfere
- **Durability**: Committed changes are persistent

Example of safe concurrent updates:

.. code-block:: python

   # Thread 1 updates event A
   ledger.update_event(event_a)
   
   # Thread 2 updates event B (happens safely in parallel)
   ledger.update_event(event_b)
   
   # Both updates are guaranteed to succeed without corruption

The ledger hierarchy
--------------------

Project data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project is the top level of the hierarchy within asimov.
Settings which are defined for the project are passed to all events and those events' analyses.

Event data
~~~~~~~~~~

Events are stored under the ``events`` key of the ledger.
All events are attached to a project, and they inherit all of the settings from their project.

Analysis data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All analyses are attached to an event, and inherit all of the settings from their event.

Pipeline data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to specifying project or event defaults, it is possible to define per-pipeline defaults in the ``pipelines`` key of the ledger, which are only used by a specific pipeline.
For example, you may wish to specify a different set of defaults for all ``bilby`` analyses compared to all ``rift`` analyses.

Applying changes to the ledger
------------------------------

There are a number of ways that changes can be applied to the ledger, for example adding new analyses, new events, or setting defaults.

1. Via the command line interface
2. By writing a ledger page and adding it to the ledger
3. By directly editing the ledger

The first two options are the recommended approach for the vast majority of situations.
While editing the ledger directly is the most powerful approach it also presents more risks.

Detector information
--------------------

Information about which detectors should be used for an analysis is contained under the ``interferometers`` key.

This should be a list of detector abbreviations, for example ``[H1, L1, V1]``.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

In order to provide the IFO list for all analyses in a given event:

.. code-block::

   - name: GW150915
     interferometers:
     - L1
     - H1
     productions:
       Prod1: ...

       
Data information
----------------

Information and settings about the data are stored under the ``data`` key.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

   data:
     calibration:
       H1: h1-calibration.dat
       L1: l1-calibration.dat
    channels:
      H1: H1:DCS-CALIB_STRAIN_C02
      L1: L1:DCS-CALIB_STRAIN_C02
    frame-types:
      H1: H1_HOFT_C02
      L1: L1_HOFT_C02
    segments:
      H1: H1:DMT-ANALYSIS_READY:1
      L1: L1:DMT-ANALYSIS_READY:1
    segment length: 4

``calibration``
  This section defines the location of the calibration splines for the analysis.
  These can either be specified relative to the event repository, or as an absolute path.
  Files should be provided for each detector, indexed by the detector abbreviation.

  For example
  
  ::
     
     data:
       calibration:
         H1: /home/cal/H1-calibration.dat
	 V1: /home/cal/V1-calibration.dat

``channels``
  This section defines the data channels which should be used in the analysis.
  These should be provided for each detector.
  For example
  
  ::
     
     data:
       channels:
	 H1: H1:DCS-CALIB_STRAIN_C02
	 L1: L1:DCS-CALIB_STRAIN_C02

``frame-types``
  This section defines the frame types which should be used in the analysis.
  These should be provided for each detector.
  For example
  
  ::
     
     data:
       frame-types:
	 H1: H1_HOFT_C02
	 L1: L1_HOFT_C02

``segments``
  This section defines the segments which should be used in the analysis.
  These should be provided for each detector.
  For example
  
  ::
     
     data:
       segments:
	 H1: H1:DMT-ANALYSIS_READY:1
	 L1: L1:DMT-ANALYSIS_READY:1

``data files``
  This section should define data files which contain the analysis data to be used
  in the analysis, and should be provided for each detector.
  For example
  
  ::
     
     data:
       data files:
         H1: ./H1-file.gwf
	 L1: ./L1-file.gwf
