The Build Process
=================

The pipelines which Asimov is designed to operate with typically use a configuration file to store the settings which will be required for the analysis, and may need access to a number of other auxilliary files.

Asimov is capable of generating or retrieving all of these files for the various pipelines it provides support for.

This document provides an overview of how an analysis is built, with pointers to the documentation for the individual steps.


Production metadata
-------------------

Each analysis handled by ``asimov`` is handled as an individual ``Production``, and metadata about the production and its assosciated ``Event`` are recorded in the ledger for the event.

An example of an event ledger might look something like this, which is for ``GW150914``:

This ledger file contains all of the information required to set up three analyses; a Bayeswave analysis (to produce the PSD files for the other analyses), a bilby analysis, and a RIFT analysis.

The metadata contained in sections such as ``quality`` and ``priors`` is then used to create the configuration files for each pipeline using a template.
Individual productions can overwrite the event metadata for any of the templatable values, allowing asimov, for example, to set up two analyses with different sample-rates.

``olivaw build``
----------------

The command line utility ``olivaw build`` is used to construct pipeline configurations by combining a configuration template for the pipeline with data from the production ledger.

This runs the ``Production.make_config()`` method, which determines the pipeline from the ledger.
If a template is provided in the metadata for the production (under the ``template`` value) then this template is used to construct the configuration file.
Otherwise the appropriate pipeline configuration template is used (e.g. ``bilby.template`` for the ``bilby`` configuration).

Metadata is then substituted into the configuration file, and the final file is committed to the event's repository, under than production's name. For example, a production called ``Prod1`` will produce an ``ini`` file called ``Prod1.ini``.

This step does not require pipeline-specific code, and so it uses only code from the ``asimov.event`` module.
This allows configurations to be generated in environments which do not have the pipelines installed.

The next step is then used to invoke pipeline-specific code.

``olivaw submit``
-----------------

Once a configuration has been generated it can be used to generate an ``htcondor`` DAG file for execution on a cluster.

The process for this step is different for each analysis pipeline.
An object for that pipeline is then created with the metadata from the production.

First ``olivaw submit`` determines the correct pipeline for the production from the ``pipeline`` value in the ledger.

First the ``build_dag`` method is called on the pipeline object.
In general each pipeline will then execute the pipeline construction utility and any additional steps required to build a DAG file (for ``bilby``, for example, the ``bilby_pipe`` tool is used to produce the DAG.

The second step performs the submission of the DAG to the cluster.
The ``submit_dag`` method is called on the pipeline object.
In general a pipeline will first run its ``before_submit`` method, which can be used by the pipeline to download any additional files, for example.
Then the DAG file is submitted to the ``htcondor`` submit node using the ``condor_submit_dag`` tool.
The ``cluster id`` for the submitted DAG is then retrieved, and stored in the manifest under the ``job id`` value for the production.
